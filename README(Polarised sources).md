#Polarised sources:
Radio galaxies are galaxies which are mostly visible (has the biggest intensity) in the radio-wave lengths. Radio galaxies are also 
characterised by having large jets (streams of mass flowing out perpendicular to the core of the galaxy in 
to space with very large/relativistic velocities). In these jets there are magnetic fields and a lots of electrons.
Due to electrons being accelerated in magnetic fields the electron sends out Magneto brehmstrahlung/synchrotron emission.
Sources of synchrotron emission are located for instance in magneto-ionised mediums in jets in radio galaxies.
The light from these sources can be detecte by using radio telescopes.
